Cinnamon – A Warm and Comfy Language

Welcome to Cinnamon, a language designed to be simple, flexible, and comforting to use. It's built for both high-level clarity and low-level control, letting you write clean, readable code while still having the power to manage memory, interact with hardware, and compile to efficient machine code.

Cinnamon isn't here to fight over benchmarks or chase trends. It's here to be pleasant to write, easy to read, and reliable to run—whether you're scripting a quick utility or building a full system from scratch.

What Cinnamon Offers

Clean Syntax – Minimal special characters, clear structure, easy to follow.

JIT + AOT Compilation – Run code dynamically or compile it into a standalone binary.

Static & Dynamic Typing – Type safety when you need it, flexibility when you don’t.

Modular Standard Library – Every library has a single purpose (I/O, networking, memory, GPU, threading), so you only include what you need.

Hardware Control – Direct memory access and threading without sacrificing readability.

Self-Contained Executables – No external dependencies; just compile and run.


A Small Taste of Cinnamon

func greet(name: string) -> string
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

print greet("world")

Simple, right? No unnecessary symbols, just clear and readable code. But when you need to dive deeper:

static var buffer: mem[1024]
buffer[0] = 42

You can.

Why Cinnamon?

Because code should feel warm and inviting—not like a chore. Cinnamon is here to make programming feel comfortable, predictable, and enjoyable. Whether you're working close to the metal or just writing a quick script, it should feel like home.
